Write a code to find the degree of each vertex, and store it in a dictionary. Sort the keys of the dictionary by the degree stored in the values.
Write a code to inter-convert the 3 graph representations we have learnt.
Given a graph and two vertices, check if they are adjacent. 
Check if a graph is complete.
Check if a graph is connected.

Check if a given graph is a tree.
Given a connected cyclic graph, find its spanning tree.
Given a tree, find the number of leaf nodes.
